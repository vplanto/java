# Module: System Design Fundamentals

> **Other language:** [Українська версія](../index.md)

## From Coder to Architect

**Module goal:** Break the “as long as it compiles” paradigm. We move from local optimization (functions) to global optimization (systems). You’ll learn to see “invisible” requirements (NFRs), estimate the cost of decisions, and build systems that survive in Production.

**Required context:**
* Understanding of HTTP/REST.
* Basic knowledge of SQL vs NoSQL.
* Engineering cynicism (we trust no one, not even the network).

## 📚 Module structure

### 1. Theory and a mental model
**[Lecture: System Design Foundations](11_system_design.md)**
*This is where we build the vocabulary and the architect’s way of thinking.*

* **Mindset:** How a `Senior Dev` differs from an `Architect`. Why code is only 20% of the job.
* **Vibe Coding:** The “Director of Code” philosophy. How to direct AI rather than just copy snippets.
* **Physics of Software:** NFRs (Scalability, Availability, Latency). Why “fast” is a bad requirement.
* **Fallacies:** 6 false assumptions about distributed systems (the network is reliable, Latency = 0).
* **Artifacts:** What does an architect leave behind? (ADR, Impact Analysis, Blueprint).

### 2. Practice and “battle-tested” engineering
**[Practice: Workshop “URL Shortener” (Ultimate Edition)](p01_system_design_workshop.md)**
*Live Design Session: We design a bit.ly clone with real-world constraints.*

* **Real Numbers:** The “elevator doors” mental model and biological limits (100ms).
* **SDLC Deep Dive:** From `Feasibility Study` to `System Design Spec`.
* **Algorithm:** Why `Random` kills the database while `Base62` doesn’t.
* **Event Decisioning:** An 8-step event processing algorithm for analytics.
* **Dev Lead Role:** How to turn a diagram into JIRA tasks, branching strategy, and DB statistics generation.
* **Runtime Survival:** Kernel tuning (`somaxconn`), continuous profiling (flamegraphs), and disaster recovery.

### 3. Case studies
**[Case Study: CAP Theorem](case_study_cap.md)**
*Practical examples of choosing between Consistency and Availability in distributed systems.*

### Homework (Artifacts)

To successfully complete the module, you must submit:
1.  **Swagger (OpenAPI) Spec** for the link shortener service (Generated by AI + Audited by Human).
2.  **Wrong Assumptions Report:** An analysis of AI mistakes in the context of distributed systems.
